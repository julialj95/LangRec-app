    Whether for work, social reasons or simply the joy of gaining a new skill, many people are expanding their horizons by learning a foreign language (or two or three!). 
    <br />
    <br />
    With a plethora of resources available, it can be challenging and costly to find the ones that will best help you to achieve your goals. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Using LangRec, you can get targeted recommendations based on your learning style, language goals and current level. Happy learning!
